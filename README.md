# HirstDotPainting
Randomized Hirst dot painting (10 x 10) implemented in Python.
This project uses the colorgram Python package to extract the 20 most prominent colors from one of Damien Hurst's works (found in HirstArt.jpg).
The turtle Python package is mostly used for the actual drawing of the dots. Simply click on the drawing box to exit.
